The media owner then embeds this virtual noticeboard with all the conversations into their Websites, Facebook pages and mobiles sites and or apps (coming soon) \

Board cover ad. This is a premium ad spot on the Mimiboard that our sales teams monetize. We then share revenue back to the board owner (Live now)\
Network ads. We have signed an agreement with an Ad Network on API level. This will automatically monetize the board. The ad will look like a note on the board. (Live in Jan) We share revenue back to the board owner\
Featured notes: This is an exciting one. Gravity pushes notes down really fast if your board is active. The audience of the media owner now has the opportunity to place a featured note on their favorite site's board. The board owner sets the CPM. The advertiser pays for the ad via carrier billing.

5561,SureSpeak,"SureSpeak is a web based coaching platform aimed at solving the current inefficiencies and costs associated with corporate training.\
\
The Problem\
\
Companies spend billions of dollars each year on training and coaching-in 2006 over $129 billion. However, this training is often ineffective or very expensive or both. \
\
Ineffective-Studies show that after 4 weeks, 85% of what was learned in a classroom setting is forgotten. Additionally, teaching interpersonal and communication skills in a classroom environment is rarely effective. Lastly, scheduling conflicts often cause inefficiency and delay in connecting a person in need of coaching and a coach. \
\
Expensive - Companies spend money on travel, lodging, meals and other related costs in order to get people to training sessions. Companies also deploy e-learning solutions which offer little or no interaction or practice and suffer from miserable completion rates.\
\
Additionally, current market conditions have caused the majority of enterprises to cut training and travel budgets significantly and look for cost effective means to deliver training enterprise-wide.\
\
The Solution\
\
SureSpeak is a Software as a Service (SaaS) provider of web-based video coaching platform and tools. Executive coaches & enterprises use SureSpeak to improve sales, presentation and communication skills leading to enhanced revenues, higher customer retention and improved operating efficiencies. SureSpeak users watch modeling videos that demonstrate desired performance â€“ for example â€œHow to close the saleâ€. Then with just an internet connection and a webcam, the user records their version and self-reviews. Typically the user will re-record multiple times until satisfied (current record to save ratio is 6:1). Practicing or role-playing in a private setting has proven to be very desirable for SureSpeak users as opposed to group role-playing which is embarrassing and counter-productive. When the user is satisfied with his â€œSureSpeakâ€ he saves, and his coach receives an automatic email alert notifying him that a SureSpeak is waiting for review. The coach then logs in from wherever he may be and whenever he has time. This is a key to the efficiency of SureSpeak. The coach provides feedback in written form, in score format â€“ based on customizable categories such as â€œbody languageâ€, â€œtoneâ€, â€œenthusiasmâ€, â€œmessage contentâ€, â€œsincerityâ€, etc. The coach also can record a video back to the user. When the coach saves his feedback the system notifies the user that his score SureSpeak has been reviewed, and likewise the user logs in when convenient to review. Additionally, each user can receive feedback from unlimited coaches, peers, managers, etc.\
\
SureSpeakâ€™s patented platform is unique in that it is asynchronous â€“ meaning the practice and coaching is split up into 3 distinct parts â€“ practice, coaching/feedback, and review of feedback. These can be done independent of each other without delay and at any time. Most training fails in that no video record is provided and if it is not efficient or readily accessible online and cannot be shared. Synchronous training solutions such as video-conference fail as they still require both parties to be available at the same time.\

5774,Nangate,"Standard-cell libraries were introduced more than 40 years ago to help IC designers keep up with the increasing complexity of IC design. But the convenience offered by predefined digital CMOS standard cells has come at the price of overall chip-level efficiency. Standard-cell-based ICs are rarely optimized for their intended application, so ICs are not as small, fast or power-efficient as they could be.\
\
Nangate cell library creation and optimization tools provide the answer to this dilemma. Nangate tools enable custom tailoring of digital cell libraries to meet specific design targets. Libraries can be optimized for design goals such as power consumption, die area, operating frequency or required yield â€“ as opposed to being designed for a broad range of standard requirements. The result: improvements in IC performance can be achieved at much lower cost and with considerably less effort than using full-custom design methods. ",mobile,,USA,1,1,16.11809565095832,2,0,0.0,0.0

The idea for Zoodles was born while Mark watched his 4-year-old daughter, Abbie, struggle while using the computer. He wondered why kids were constantly trying to adapt to computers rather than having the computers adapt to them. After talking with dozens of other parents, it became clear that they were all equally frustrated with the experiences their children were having online.\
\
While parents universally believed that the computer could help their kids learn, they just didn't have the time or resources to scour the web and find any of this fun, educational content themselves. Additionally, parents wanted more say over what their children were doing online. Without trusted content, they really didn't want to open up the whole, sometimes scary, web to their young kids.\
\
Mark decided it was time to build a safe, fun, and educational online experience for kids that also gave parents the information and control they wanted. After discussing the idea with his friend, Rich, they decided to form a company to build Zoodles. â€¨\
\
Since then, the team has grown to include incredibly talented engineers, educational experts, and creative designers who understand how to build simple interfaces for kids. The team is excited to be working on a product that can change how children learn while giving parents an active role in the experience.

Consumers describe what they need done and specify when and where their job should take place.  Using patent-pending machine learning and semantic technology, Redbeacon determines the best local service providers for the job.  If matched, service providers get notified by email and text message and are given the opportunity to submit a price quote.  Consumers can then select and book appointments with their top choice service provider based on a comparison of business profiles, price quotes, and ratings and reviews from past Redbeacon consumers. \

Service Providers only pay a small commission when they win a job, which minimizes the risk of wasted marketing dollars.

Punch can update App content in real time, providing a publishing environment that’s as timely as the Web, with the fit and finish people have come to expect from tablet-native Apps.  Without the need for programmers.\
\
Founded in spring 2011 by a team of seasoned technology and media entrepreneurs with experience in digital marketing, iOS development, consumer media, and business strategy.  Punch is based in New York City.\
\
Punch delivers content, known as “mini Apps,” through three components.\
\
An App Content Management System (ACMS), accessible through any web browser, provides the authoring environment where tablet native experiences are assembled. These are crafted by first selecting from a range of technical modules, and then uploading into these modules the assets, such as text, images, video, and the instructions, such as animation parameters, that make the content dynamic and interactive. The end result is a series of items that, taken together, become your App. The content management system is accessible through any web browser connected to the Internet.\
\
Upon completion of each individual item, the content manager sends the instructions that constitute that item to the Punch server. The server exists on the Internet and stores all the items (assets plus instructions on how they interrelate). Think of each item as a “mini App.”\
\
On individual tablets, users download the client App. The client App is a vessel that communicates with the Punch server and receives the assets and instructions for assembling the individual mini Apps that ultimately constitute the end-user experience. Mini Apps can be updated in real time, and the client Apps then download the updated content. This allows for a highly dynamic and responsive publishing environment. Each client App Appears in the App Store under the publisher’s brand. No two client Apps look the same.\

\
Retailers of unique items (antique dealers, thrift stores, etc.) struggle to scale online because populating, hosting and promoting an online store is time and resource intensive. While retailers know that online marketing is vital to increase customer reach, traffic & sales, they struggle to justify the time & money it takes to establish an online presence.\
\
InvenQuery is the answer.  \
\
InvenQuery’s web + mobile applications unite dispersed sellers of unique goods to populate a single online marketplace. Retailers that join an IQ marketplace benefit from inclusion in a well-designed, high traffic website, an easy mobile app for uploading their items, and social media sharing tools that showcase products where their customers actively search and share. \
\
Through a niche marketplace, multiple retailers can join forces to attract their ideal customers. With our simple mobile app they showcase items on a marketplace, their own site, & their social media networks in seconds. By leveraging social media, IQ helps retailers amplify traditional marketing by driving shoppers to the marketplace. By aggregating sellers of similar items into one online marketplace, IQ creates a go-to resource for an industry.\
\
IQ is making economic, environmental and social impact serving the first of several vertical markets: the discount home improvement retail industry (e.g. reuse centers). Reuse centers take donations of reclaimed building materials and sell them to fund a variety of social and environmental initiatives, such as Habitat for Humanity’s home building efforts or Reclaim Detroit’s deconstruction job training program. \
\
Currently, the $270 million material reuse industry is growing 15% per year, selling less than 5% of all inventories online. Yet 78% of home improvement projects start with an online search. IQ enables reuse centers to market their products where customers are shopping. With the IQ mobile application sellers can display inventories on an IQ marketplace website, their store’s website, and on popular social media sites, in a single workflow. IQ makes it easy for reuse centers to reach more customers with unique inventories, to solicit more donations, and ultimately, to provide valuable social and environmental conservation services to communities across the country. As reused material transactions increase, the IQ platform is poised to integrate with inventory and sales tracking technologies, enabling the capture of valuable transaction and landfill diversion data. \

\
Once Boxbe is configured, email messages are automatically prioritized and screened as they arrive.  Priority is based primarily upon the sender's identity.  A member's priority list is automatically updated, and can also be viewed and edited directly. The company  performs several checks to verify the authenticity of email senders.  Some messages are modified to provide navigation links when delivered.  \
\
A controversial aspect of the service is its 'Courtesy Notice', a short email notice sent in behalf of a member to the sender of a message when they are unknown.  The notice provides the sender with a link that lets them have their message ""promoted"".  \
\
The service also encourages its members to invite their friends, claiming that doing so will improve the handling and priority given to email through its ""Friend of Friend"" feature.  Perhaps due to poorly worded screens or navigation, some members have been angered when they inadvertently invite their entire address books.  Consequently, Boxbe has been accused of creating spam to promote their service.

peerTransfer offers a secure, seamless, and easy-to-navigate system for students that enables them to pay in their home currency, and also saves them a significant amount of money when doing so.  For many currencies, peerTransfer provides foreign exchange rates unmatched by traditional banks.  These rates can result in a significant savings â€“ up to thousands of dollars per each year of tuition.  And, unlike large financial institutions, peerTransfer provides international 24x7 support across multiple channels â€“ voice, Skype, chat or email â€“ to guide students through the process.  peerTransfer is completely free for schools, can be turned on in a matter of hours and has been proven to save overhead, by ensuring all student information is included in the transfer.\
\
Headquartered in Boston, Mass., peerTransfer also maintains offices in Valencia, Spain. It is backed by international investors (including Spark Capital, a $1Billion Venture Capital fund).\

In 1999, brothers Evan and Gregg Spiridellis saw an opportunity to create a new entertainment brand based on two emerging trends. First, off the shelf software was leveling the playing field for creators.  Meaning the tools needed to produce high quality productions were no longer the exclusive domain of megamedia conglomerates that could afford mega-million budgets.  Second, the Internet offered independent creators the ability to bypass traditional media gatekeepers and build a direct relationship with their audiences.  The brothers dreamed of creating a globally recognized entertainment brand because they did not have the media industry experience to realize what an insane goal that was.\
\
It took Evan and Gregg almost 5 years of toiling away before they experienced major success.  On July 9, 2004 they launched This Land, an animated political satire and, overnight, JibJab became the global brand they dreamed of creating.\

With lifeAssist™, producers store all of their policy data in one secure location, allowing the system to continuously analyze each policy and determine whether or not it is sustainable and whether there is a better alternative. Whenever an opportunity is identified, which occurs with about 25% of in-force policies, a client-ready report is generated, illustrating the short and long term cost implications of the client’s current plan versus alternatives and using proprietary logic to explain a set of recommendations. This gives producers the opportunity to catch policies before they lapse, and generate a sale, without requiring a heavy commitment of their time. \
\
With a shrinking and aging broker force, fewer agents are available to service policies, and the pool of ‘orphan’ policyholders has risen dramatically. In addition, insurance professionals need to be made aware of the problems within their inforce book of business and need to know how to order and analyze in-force data and make appropriate recommendations.

\
Prezi was officially launched in 2009 by co-founders Adam Somlai-Fischer, Peter Halacsy and Peter Arvai. \
\
Adam Somlai-Fischer is an internationally renowned architect and visual artist who has been working with zooming presentations since 2001. Adam found that a zoomable user interface (ZUI) enabled him to explore the ""big picture"" overview of a floor plan and then zoom into the detail of individual rooms. Because there was no commercially-available zooming presentation editor, each presentation had to be coded by hand. Audiences were wowed and approached Adam to discover what presentation software he used. A few persuaded him to give them access to his code. Finally, in 2007, Budapest University of Technology professor Peter Halacsy convinced Adam to develop an editor so that anyone could make zooming presentations. After creating a prototype, they recruited a business-minded entrepreneur, Peter Arvai, to join as CEO to help them build a product and a company. Prezi was launched in April 2009 from Budapest, leading to investments from TED Conferences and Sunstone Capital. The San Francisco office was established in November 2009.

Finding itself far behind competitor YouTube in terms of pure user numbers, the company (then grouper) began differentiating its product by changing its architecture.  Originally a downloadable program, grouper became browser based and added a desktop video editor and a closed P2P content distribution element to its arsenal.  With perfect software for a major distributor but a lack of users, Grouper was a prime target for acquisition and was bought by Sony for $65 million, approaching $120 per user by some estimates.  \
\
Reportedly Grouper turned down a $10 million second round of financing to gain the content support of the major media company.  President of Grouper, David Samuel, was no stranger to acquisitions, having sold his old company, Spinner.com, to AOL in 1999 for $320 million.  Grouper was set to become a distribution platform for Sony's vast video catalogue, a streaming video site for lower quality video and a place where fans could make mashups of Sony Content.\
\
Grouper was quiet for a while after its acquisition, however, it was reborn Crackle after a complete overhaul of its website in July of 2007.  Crackle is now a destination video site for professional producers and anyone hoping to become one.  Crackle consists of 12 channels which range in flavor from animation to news.  Crackle is ad supported.\

\
In an era when mainstream investment firms are turning away clients with less than $100,000 in assets to invest, SaveDaily makes it possible for banks to provide an alternative saving and/or investment option to the masses. \
\
If I were to ask you to put your entire savings or retirement into a saving account or money market account you would probably laugh. These account typically yield very little return usually less than a quarter percent. Until now the wealth have been the only people with access to true managed financial services and the opportunity to gain significant financial returns. While this has been the case the average person or even the low income individual have been told that while they arguably are the ones that need a return on their finances the most, they are to use products that don't help them achieve their financial goals. \
\
SaveDaily is changing that. We have developed a technology solution that allows our financial institution partners to offer the best managed fund investments in the world to a group of consumers with very little incremental dollars to invest. Truly the 90% of people out there. Do you have $5 USD to invest but the fund you want to invest in has a $100,000 minimum? With SaveDaily now you are able to invest like the wealth regardless of investment size without the worry of minimum investment size or things like transaction fees or loads. Truly a system to allow you access to WallStreet investments. \
\
For a simply monthly account fee typically $5.95 a month you will have no transaction fees with unlimited positions and no minimums. Now regardless of if you have $1,000,000 or $100 you can have access to managed money without the surprises of hidden fees. SaveDaily is the next evolution of discounted investment platforms. We desire for your financial goals to become a reality.....\

Feedvisor Repricing Platform enables retailers to fully manage pricing of their inventory to optimize their sales and profit margins.

\
Feedvisor Amazon Repricer is a web based solution, that means retailers are not required to install anything on their computers.\
\
Prior to Feedvisor launch Amazon sellers used to rely on a range of primitive repricing software packages that demanded from sellers to pre-program repricing rules upfront. However while it was sufficient in the early days, this approach started to generate inferior results as Amazon Marketplace platform evolved and became more sophisticated in ranking sellers. In E-Commerce Marketplaces such as Amazon, Buy.com and Sears retailer's sales volume tied to retailer's ability to hold what is called a BuyBox - a top ranked position among offers for a given product. Each retailer has different rating on each marketplace and the Marketplace grants the BuyBox only to a retailer with optimal combination of seller' rating and product pricing.\
\
Feedvisor Repricing Solution came to enable retailers to manage their operations in an increasingly sophisticated marketplace environments. Based on artificial intelligence computer technology of a kind typically used in financial markets, Feedvisor algorithms learn each and every situation and take the necessary action, emulating a human decision making. For example, Feedvisor Repricer is capable to detect patterns such as price war or on contrary a signal by a competitor to raise prices.\

Several generations of prototypes later, Dave was invited to share their early work by giving a presentation on the main stage at the TED conference in 2009 - and the talk went viral. This public enthusiasm galvanized the pair to found Sifteo Inc., and four months later Dave and Jeevan were at work in San Francisco building a company. \

\
Pearescope users do not need to subscribe to another social network, rather, this service enables existing networks to come offline and into the real-world with a self-regulated balance of privacy and connectivity. \
\
How it works:\
Users set their ""spotlight"", the area in which they wish to be seen around their smartphone, and apply their social networks to that geographic area. Users may also define their ""surface time"", the duration in which they want to be actively networking with those nearby. ONLY when their spotlights and surface times of two users overlap, and both share a mutual connection, will Pearescope send an icebreaking text message to both members: ""John, Jane is in your spotlight who also knows your friend Jon Smith.""\
\
Why its different:\
Pearescope is check-in free and private.  This service provides social access through mutual connections. Pearescope allows users to cherry-pick the most important and meaningful relationships from their second network through a demographic filter. Such filters include gender, school, and relationship status. Its patent pending technology only alerts members if both are within each other's spotlights. For example, if Jane sets her spotlight to 5 miles and Jon sets his to 500 feet, both would only be introduced if Jane was inside Jon's spotlight. \
